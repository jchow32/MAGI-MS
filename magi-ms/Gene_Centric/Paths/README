	Required Parameters 
	$PPI <PPI Network> 
		The input file should be a file of binary interactions. File input format:<Gene_Name_1><\t><Gene_Name_2> (Example: String_HPRD_PPI) 
	$caseGene <seed gene>
		Seed gene. File input format:<Gene_Name> (Example:file containing one line with gene name, like SCN1A) 
	$geneCoexpressionID <Gene CoExpression Id>
		The input gives the order of each gene appearing in the coExpression table. FIle input format: <Gene_row_id><\t>OTHER_ID<\t><Gene_Name> (Example: GeneCoExpresion_ID)
	$coexpressionMatrix <CoExpression Matrix>
		Pairwise gene coexpression values. File input format:<Gene_Name_1><\t><Gene_Name_2><\t><CoExpression - r^6> (example: adj1.csv.Tab.BinaryFormat)
		Note that the genes pairs are sorted based on their <Gene_row_id> provided in the file inputed as -h parameters. 
	$controlMutationList <control mutation list>
		The number of mutations in each gene in controls. File input format:<Gene_Name_1><\t><number of mutations in control> (example: New_ESP_Sereve)
	$geneLength <Length of genes>
		This file includes the length of each gene. File input format:<Gene Name><\t><Length> (example : Gene_Name_Length)
	$ID <run id>
		The id for this run (integer)
	
Output:
1) RandomGeneList.%i: The list of genes with their assigned score (based on mutations in cases) and total number of mutation in controls 
2) BestPaths.Length%i.Control%i.Run%i: The seeds created (a total of 1000 seed per type), for different lengths (default is from 5 to 8) and total mutations in control (ranging from 0 to 4)
